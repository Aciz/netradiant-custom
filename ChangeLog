	* all: added a Makefile to build GtkRadiant with q3map2. Currently without
	  plugins, will add these back later

2008-09-13 Rudolf Polzer divVerent(at)alientrap.org
	* q3map2: update to ZeroRadiant's q3map2
	* q3map2: added lightmap exposure feature: -exposure 4.2 (Urban Terror)
	* q3map2: check whether a lightmap sample is actually in the triangle
	  (Urban Terror)
	* q3map2: nudge light sample origin by 1qu away from planes (Urban Terror)
	* q3map2: floodlight: usage is "_floodlight" "red green blue distance
	  intensity", default "240 240 255 1024 128"; works somewhat similar to
	  dirtmapping (Urban Terror); uses a switch -lowquality
	* q3map2: added -debugnormals feature (Urban Terror)
	* q3map2: fix -convert -format map decompiling (note: outputs map in
	  "Alternate Texture Projection" format); no longer messes up texcoords
	* q3map2: added -game nexuiz to use good default paths for Nexuiz
	* q3map2: added -game quakelive to enable in-game adverts
	* q3map2: fix incorrect plane snapping often causing holes in terrain
	* q3map2: spawnflags on misc_model: 8 extrudes with original normals, 16
	  extrudes with up/down normals (terrain), default: extrudes with axial
	  normals (like before)
	* q3map2: fix obvious (and reported, and patch sent in) bug when importing
	  models when the normals were pointing in a 45 degrees direction
	* q3map2: when importing models, allow "surfaceparms structural". This
	  also turns off any plane snapping, as it is intended for caulk brushes
	  inside a model
	* q3map2: added parameters -ne to set normal epsilon, and -de to set
	  distance epsilon (to customize plane snapping)
	* q3map2: fix q3map_lightRGB (Urban Terror)
	* q3map2: add a build script to cross compile q3map2 to Win32
	* radiant: when displaying normals on a model, scale them to 8 unit size
	  on the output (so "modelscale" can be used without LOTS of lines on the
	  screen)
	* radiant: also support "killtarget" as target key for drawing the
	  targeting lines
	* radiant: "expand selection to whole entities" now also selects the
	  entity ITSELF; result: Ctrl-Alt-E Space makes a NEW entity now, instead of
	  just duplicating the brush (old behaviour caused bugs in maps with copied
	  func_ladders)
	* picomodel: support .obj format as exported by Blender, with a .mtl file
	  defining the shader names for each material; to export using Blender,
	  enable "Materials" and "Material Groups" in the .obj export dialog
	* all: bump version to 1.5.0-div0
