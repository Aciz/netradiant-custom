	* q3map2: -convert -format ase -shadersasbitmap convert mode that writes
	  the shader names in the *BITMAP field in the .ase. That way, the .ase
	  files work without changing as mapobjects.

2008-10-12 Rudolf Polzer divVerent(at)alientrap.org
	* q3map2: fix the deluxemap contribution from ambient lighting. minLight
	  is still broken with deluxemapping. If you must use minLight, combine it
	  with 1/2 or 1/4 of its amount in ambient.

	* q3map2: fix deluxemap when lit from the wrong side as good as possible
	  (by ignoring the deluxemap contribution). now the invariant "deluxemap
	  vector points away from the surface" should hold. Avoids sudden black
	  spots when deluxemapping.

2008-09-26 Rudolf Polzer divVerent(at)alientrap.org
	* q3map2: turn the Urban Terror vis nudge and triangle check into options
	  -extravisnudge and -trianglecheck, as they break some Nexuiz maps.
	  Evaluate the usefulness of these options later.
	* q3map2: make sure the intermediate .bsp when bouncing always is loadable
	  into the game (by unparsing the entities, so if gridsize got modified,
	  that change gets written too)

2008-09-23 Rudolf Polzer divVerent(at)alientrap.org
	* q3map2: print a warning if the specified samplesize cannot be used with
	  the current lightmap size

2008-09-22 Rudolf Polzer divVerent(at)alientrap.org
	* q3map2: add dotProduct2scale alphamod
	* q3map2: add -minsamplesize command line option to override lightmapscale
	  specified in map files

2008-09-19 Rudolf Polzer divVerent(at)alientrap.org
	* radiant: add a "Strafe Mode" option
	* radiant: ctrl-tab now focuses all XYZ views in the three-part view (as
	  that is what the user is likely to want there)
	* radiant: make rotate/scale dialogs non-modal

2008-09-18 Rudolf Polzer divVerent(at)alientrap.org
	* radiant: handle missing anisotropy extension; fixes display bug on
	  Windows XP software renderer
	* radiant: make logging kick in earlier
	* radiant: add svn release to the version number

2008-09-15 Rudolf Polzer divVerent(at)alientrap.org
	* all: added a Makefile to build GtkRadiant; this replaces scons and
	  python install.py
	* all: got rid of libmhash dependency, using mdfour.c from DarkPlaces
	  instead
	* q2data: remove RSA security copyrighted md4.c, using mdfour.c from DP
	  instead as a drop-in replacement
	* all: get rid of version.h and aboutmsg.h, instead set the version in the
	  Makefile
	* all: support cross compiling using mingw32

2008-09-13 Rudolf Polzer divVerent(at)alientrap.org
	* q3map2: update to ZeroRadiant's q3map2
	* q3map2: added lightmap exposure feature: -exposure 4.2 (Urban Terror)
	* q3map2: check whether a lightmap sample is actually in the triangle
	  (Urban Terror)
	* q3map2: nudge light sample origin by 1qu away from planes (Urban Terror)
	* q3map2: floodlight: usage is "_floodlight" "red green blue distance
	  intensity", default "240 240 255 1024 128"; works somewhat similar to
	  dirtmapping (Urban Terror); uses a switch -lowquality
	* q3map2: added -debugnormals feature (Urban Terror)
	* q3map2: fix -convert -format map decompiling (note: outputs map in
	  "Alternate Texture Projection" format); no longer messes up texcoords
	* q3map2: added -game nexuiz to use good default paths for Nexuiz
	* q3map2: added -game quakelive to enable in-game adverts
	* q3map2: fix incorrect plane snapping often causing holes in terrain
	* q3map2: spawnflags on misc_model: 8 extrudes with original normals, 16
	  extrudes with up/down normals (terrain), default: extrudes with axial
	  normals (like before)
	* q3map2: fix obvious (and reported, and patch sent in) bug when importing
	  models when the normals were pointing in a 45 degrees direction
	* q3map2: when importing models, allow "surfaceparms structural". This
	  also turns off any plane snapping, as it is intended for caulk brushes
	  inside a model
	* q3map2: added parameters -ne to set normal epsilon, and -de to set
	  distance epsilon (to customize plane snapping)
	* q3map2: fix q3map_lightRGB (Urban Terror)
	* q3map2: add a build script to cross compile q3map2 to Win32
	* radiant: when displaying normals on a model, scale them to 8 unit size
	  on the output (so "modelscale" can be used without LOTS of lines on the
	  screen)
	* radiant: also support "killtarget" as target key for drawing the
	  targeting lines
	* radiant: "expand selection to whole entities" now also selects the
	  entity ITSELF; result: Ctrl-Alt-E Space makes a NEW entity now, instead of
	  just duplicating the brush (old behaviour caused bugs in maps with copied
	  func_ladders)
	* picomodel: support .obj format as exported by Blender, with a .mtl file
	  defining the shader names for each material; to export using Blender,
	  enable "Materials" and "Material Groups" in the .obj export dialog
	* all: bump version to 1.5.0-div0
