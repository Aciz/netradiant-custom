msi installer HOWTO for Radiant 1.5
-----------------------------------

Requirements:

- all game packs from https://zerowing.idsoftware.com/svn/radiant.gamepacks/*Pack/trunk/ must be present in the ./games/ folder
- the Radiant manual from https://zerowing.idsoftware.com/svn/radiant.gamepacks/Q3Rad_Manual/trunk/ in ./docs/manual/
- msitools from http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/files/radiant/developer/1.5/msitools.zip.


Building a new installer .msi file: 

- Unzip msitools.zip to ./setup/win32/ and run MsiVal2.Msi (it automatically installes to C:\Program files\MsiVal2).
- Copy all files from C:\Program files\MsiVal2 to the ./setup/win32/ folder.
- You might have to edit the .xml files in ./setup/win32/components/
- Create a file "aboutmsg.default" in ./include containing a single line:
  Official qeradiant.com build by <insert your name here>
- Open a command-prompt in ./ and run "makeversion.py"
- Build the GtkRadiant solution in 'Release' configuration.
- If you want to create a .msi installer for GtkRadiant, go on with the next step. To create a game pack
  .msi installer you have to modify the file "build.py".
- Open a command-prompt in ./setup/win32/ and run "build.py". This will create the installer
  file GtkRadiant-1.5.0-[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD].msi


Additional information:

If you want to build the msi-Installer wiht Python 2.4 you have to modify msiquery.vcproj ('Release' configuration)
located in ./setup/win32/msi/ (include paths and linker libraries) and rebuild it
