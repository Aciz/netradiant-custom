printf mess in q3map
(and in the libs)

q3map: several breeds .. qprintf _printf printf
should all resolve to use a single Sys_Printf thing
and put #define printf ..

for the static libs? need to use function pointers..

q3map uses common/cmdlib.c
Radiant links against cmdlib.lib based on libs/cmdlib/cmdlib.cpp

but eventually we'll want to use the same Sys_Printf scheme in q3map AND Radiant?
qprintf and _printf are defined in common/cmdlib.c
BUT: modifying cmdlib would probably break bspc and other stuff that relies on it?

moving q3map to use a custom version of cmdlib.c in q3map/cmdlib.c
removing the qprintf and _printf stuff, moving to a seperate printout.c file

compiling libxml on win32: need to turn off a bunch of stuff.
problem: we got two xmlversion.h files??
we can't get rid of using libxml/xmlversion.h, so the solution is to get rid of xmlversion.h
(add ../libxml to the paths)

fuck!
we also compile some .c files from common/ !
-> create a common2/ dir ..
